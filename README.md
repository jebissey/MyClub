# 🚀 Getting Started

> This quick guide will take you from a freshly downloaded archive to a running and secured instance.

## 1) Download the latest release
- Get the last relase [here](https://github.com/jebissey/MyClub/releases).  

## 2) Upload to your hosting
- Unpack the archive **locally** and then **upload** *WebSite* files to your hosting.

## 3) Log in with the administrator account and change email/password
- Open your site’s URL and log 🫥 in using the **initial administrator account** { admin account = webmaster ＠ myclub ․ foo ( admin1234 ) }.
- Go to **your avatar > Account** 🤔🧑‍💼:
  - Immediately change your **name** and **email address**.
  - **Sign out** and use **forgotten password** to create your password.

## 4) Create groups with authorizations
- Navigate to **Administration zone > Webmaster**:
  1. **Create groups** with their **authorizations** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑.
  2. **Assign authorizations** to user(s) 🎟️.

### Initial account & Webmaster group (fresh installs)
On a fresh installation the application creates **one initial user account** and **one group** named **Webmaster**.  
- The initial administrator account **cannot be deleted** and is the **only member** of the `Webmaster` group by default.  
- The `Webmaster` group holds the highest level of access but not enable to do everything directly.

**Recommended first step:** create a new group (e.g., `Full`) that is granted **all available authorizations**, then add your regular admin user(s) to that group. This lets you use a daily admin account for routine tasks while keeping the original initial account reserved for emergency recovery and sensitive operations.

## 5) Fill in the settings [HomeDesigner]
- Go to **Administration zone > Designer** 🎨🔧

- Configure the **general settings** of the application (title, description, logo, etc.).

## 6) Create event types and requirements [EventDesigner]
- Go to **Administration zone > Designer** 🎨🗓️/📋
- **Create event types** (walks, meetings, trainings, etc.).
- Define **requirements and constraints** for each type (duration, participants, equipment, etc.).

## 7) Create navigation bars [NavbarDesigner]
- Go to **Administration zone > NavbarDesigner** 🎨📑
- **Design and customize navigation bars** for different user roles.

## 8) Create self-registration and authorizationless groups [PersonManager]
- Go to **Administration zone > PersonManager** 👥
- **Create groups without authorizations**, marked as self-registrable.
- Add users to these groups.

## 9) Write articles [Redactor]
- Go to **Administration zone > Redactor** ✍️
- **Write and manage articles** (drafts, editing, formatting).
- **Review and publish articles** to make them visible to groups or users but not the public.

## 10) Publish public articles [Editor]
- Go to **Articles list > Editor** 📢
- **Review and publish articles** to make them visible to groups, users or the public.

# 💾 Data & Backup  

All the site content is stored in a **SQLite database**:  
- Main data: `WebSite/data/MyClub.sqlite`  
- Logs: `WebSite/data/LogMyClub.sqlite`  

A **GFS backup** is created every time an article is saved, stored under:  
`WebSite/backup/<years>/<months>/<weekdays>/`  

> As the IT saying goes: *“Any data stored on a single medium is doomed to disappear.”*  
It is essential to **regularly copy `MyClub.sqlite` to another physical storage** to ensure data safety.
