# MyClub

This web application is designed to make life easier for members of an association. It offers several key features:

**Viewing articles:** Members can read and share articles written by other members of the association.

**Activity management:** It's easy to sign up for the various activities offered by the association. You can also retrieve an iCal file to update your personal diary.

**User preferences:** Save your preferences for the types of events you like and your weekly availability. This allows you to filter the events on offer according to your preferences and schedule.

**Secure identification:** Users are identified by their e-mail address. When they log in for the first time, they must use the ‘forgotten password’ option to create a password.


This is a generic application.

It behaves like a **mini CMS** with articles and events.

All data is stored in a **SQLight** database.
